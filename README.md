Isabelle formalisation of CRDTs
===============================

This repository shows how to use [Isabelle](http://isabelle.in.tum.de/)
(theorem-proving software) to prove the correctness of several operation-based
[CRDTs](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00555588) (data structures that can be edited
concurrently and merged automatically).
