\section{Related Work}
\label{sect.relatedwork}

In particular, we study the Replicated Growable Array (RGA) CRDT~\cite{Roh:2011dw}, which represents
a collaboratively editable document as a sequence of characters. There are previous pen-and-paper
correctness proofs of RGA in the literature~\cite{Attiya:2016kh,Kleppmann:2016ve,Roh:2009ws}, but to
our knowledge, ours is the first mechanized proof of the convergence of RGA.

In doing so, we go much further than previous correctness proofs of collaborative editing
algorithms. Previous formalizations of OT using theorem
provers~\cite{Imine:2003ks,Imine:2006kn,Sinchuk:2016cf,Jungnickel:2015ua} focus on proving that the
transformation functions satisfy given properties (such as the transformation properties
$\mathit{TP}_1$ and $\mathit{TP}_2$~\cite{Oster:2006tr,Ressel:1996wx}), and do not explicitly model
the network. A previous formalization of CRDTs~\cite{Zeller:2014fl}, also using Isabelle, considers
other datatypes (sets, registers, counters) but not the ordered sequence datatype provided by RGA.


\subsection{Formal Verification}

Zeller et al. have used Isabelle to formally specify and verify a number of state-based CRDTs~\cite{Zeller:2014fl}.

Some operational transformation functions have also been formally specified and verified using the
SPIKE theorem prover~\cite{Imine:2003ks,Imine:2006kn}, Coq~\cite{Sinchuk:2016cf}, and
Isabelle~\cite{Jungnickel:2015ua}. These efforts focus on proving that the transformation functions
satisfy given properties (such as the \emph{transformation properties} $\mathit{TP}_1$ and
$\mathit{TP}_2$~\cite{Oster:2006tr,Ressel:1996wx}).

control algorithm (also known as integration algorithm)

Prove commutativity properties of the transformation function, but do not formally relate these
properties to a particular network model. Informal reasoning is used to demonstrate that these
properties do indeed ensure convergence in all possible
executions~\cite{Suleiman:1998eu,Sun:1998vf}.
