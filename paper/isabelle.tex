\section{Formalising system models using Isabelle}
\label{sect.isabelle}

We now introduce our formalisation of distributed systems in which we are able to prove that the strong eventual consistency (SEC) properties hold for a selection of operation-based CRDTs.
All of our proofs are checked with the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant~\cite{DBLP:conf/tphol/WenzelPN08}.
In this section, we provide a high-level summary of our proof strategy, and introduce the key concepts and syntax of Isabelle.
A detailed description of the main modules of our proof follows in Sections~\ref{sect.abstract.convergence} to \ref{sect.rga}.

\subsection{High-level proof strategy}
\label{sect.high-level.proof.strategy}

\end{figure}

Since our formalisation of distributed algorithms goes into more depth than most prior work, it is important to have a structure that keeps the proofs manageable.
Our approach breaks the proof into simple modules with cleanly defined properties---called \emph{locales}---and composes them in order to describe more complex objects.
This locale structure is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig.proof.structure} and explained below.

Approximately half of our Isabelle proof (by lines of code) is used to construct a general-purpose model of consistency in distributed systems, and is independent of any particular replication algorithm.
The other half contains our formalisation of three example CRDTs and their proofs of correctness.
By keeping the general-purpose modules abstract and implementation-independent, we construct a library of specifications and theorems that can be reused for future proofs.

Our definition of correctness in this work is that the algorithms achieve strong eventual consistency as described in Section~\ref{sect.eventual.consistency}.
We describe our formalisation of this definition in Section~\ref{sect.abstract.convergence}.
In particular, we define what we mean with convergence, and prove an \emph{abstract convergence theorem}, which states that replicas converge if concurrent operations commute.
We are able to prove this fact without mentioning networks nor any particular CRDT, but merely by reasoning about the ordering and properties of operations.

In Section~\ref{sect.network} we describe an axiomatic model of asynchronous networks, built around a broadcast-deliver event model.
The definition of the network is important because it allows us to prove that certain properties hold in all possible executions of the network, and that we are not making any assumptions that might be violated---an aspect that has dogged previous verification efforts (see Section~\ref{sect.related.verification}).
The network is the only part of our proof in which we make any axiomatic assumptions, and we show in Section~\ref{sect.network} that our assumptions are realistic and reflect standard conventions for the modelling of distributed systems.
We then prove that our network satisfies the ordering properties required by the abstract convergence theorem of Section~\ref{sect.abstract.convergence}, and thus deduce a convergence theorem for our network model.

Note that everything mentioned until this point is completely generic, and not tied to any particular replication algorithm or CRDT implementation.
However, we may now use the general-purpose theorems and definitions to prove the SEC properties of concrete algorithms.

We begin in Section~\ref{sect.simple.crdts} with definitions of two simple CRDTs: a counter and an observed-remove set.
We show that with the previously established tooling in place, it is very easy to prove that these algorithms provide SEC.

In Section~\ref{sect.rga} we describe our formalisation of a more complex and subtle CRDT, the Replicated Growable Array (RGA).
We first show how to implement the RGA's insert and delete operations, with proofs that each operation commutes with itself, and all operations commute with each other.
Insertion and deletion only commute under various conditions, so we prove that these conditions are satisfied in all possible executions of the network, and thus we obtain a concrete convergence theorem for our RGA implementation.

\subsection{An overview of Isabelle}
\label{subsect.an.overview.of.isabelle}

To aid the understanding of later sections, we provide a brief introduction to the key concepts and syntax of Isabelle.
Readers who are already familiar with Isabelle may skip to Section~\ref{sect.abstract.convergence}.
A more detailed introduction can be found in the standard tutorial material~\cite{DBLP:books/sp/NipkowK14}.

Isabelle/HOL is a logic with a strict, polymorphic type system resembling that of mainstream functional programming languages.
\emph{Function types} are written $\tau_1 \Rightarrow \tau_2$, and are inhabited by \emph{total} functions, mapping elements of $\tau_1$ to elements of $\tau_2$.
We write $\tau_1 \times \tau_2$ for the \emph{product type} of $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$, inhabited by pairs of elements of type $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$, respectively.
In a similar fashion to Standard ML and OCaml, but differing from Haskell, \emph{type operators} are applied to arguments in reverse order, and therefore write $\tau\ \isa{list}$ and $\tau\ \isa{set}$ for the type of lists of elements of type $\tau$, and the type of mathematical (i.e. potentially infinite) sets of type $\tau$, respectively.
Type variable are written in lowercase, and preceded with a prime: ${\isacharprime}a \Rightarrow {\isacharprime}a$ denotes the type of a polymorphic identity function, for example.
\emph{Tagged union} types are introduced with the $\isacommand{datatype}$ keyword, with constructors of these types written with an initial upper case letter.

In Isabelle/HOL's term language we write $\isa{t} \isa{::} \tau$ for a \emph{type ascription}, constraining the type of the term $\isa{t}$ to the type $\tau$.
We write $\lambda{x}. t$ for an anonymous function mapping an argument $\isa{x}$ to $\isa{t(x)}$, and write the application of term $\isa{t}$ with function type to an argument $\isa{u}$ as $\isa{t\ u}$, as usual.
Terms of list type are introduced using one of two constructors: $\isa{[]}$, or `nil', standing for the empty list, and infix $\isa{\#}$, or `cons', which prepends an element to an existing list.
We use $[t_1, \ldots, t_n]$ as syntactic sugar for a list literal, which is desugared into a series of cons applications.
We write $\{\}$ for the empty set, and use usual mathematical notation for set union, disjunction, membership tests, and so on: $\isa{t} \cup \isa{u}$, $\isa{t} \cap \isa{u}$, and $\isa{x} \in \isa{t}$.

Terms with type $\isa{bool}$ are called \emph{formulae}, writing $\isa{True}$ and $\isa{False}$ for the logical truthity and falsity constants, respectively.
We write $\isa{t} \longrightarrow \isa{u}$, $\isa{t} \wedge \isa{u}$, and $\isa{t} \vee \isa{u}$ for material implication, conjunction, and disjunction, respectively, between formulae, and write $\neg t$ for the negation of a formula.
Isabelle/HOL's equality constant is polymorphic: we write $t = u$ for an assertion of equality between two terms of the same type.
We write $\forall{x}.t$ and $\exists{x}.t$ for universal and existential quantification---and write $\forall{x{\in}t}.u$ and $\exists{x{\in}t}.u$ for their bounded forms, restricted to members of a set $\isa{t}$.
An alternative implication arrow $\isa{t} \Longrightarrow \isa{u}$ may sometimes be used, and is in fact required by Isabelle in certain contexts---an artefact of Isabelle's status as a logical framework.
This arrow can safely be read as a standard implication arrow with little loss of understanding.

New non-recursive definitions are entered into Isabelle's global context via the $\mathbf{definition}$ keyword.
Recursive functions are entered via the $\mathbf{fun}$ keyword, with functions being defined piecewise by pattern matching on inputs with a series of equations.
All function are total, and therefore recursive functions must be provably terminating, in that they recurse on arguments that are `smaller' with respect to a well-founded relation.
All termination proofs in this work are generated automatically by Isabelle itself.

Inductive relations are introduced with the $\mathbf{inductive}$ keyword.
An inductive relation definition of the form
\vspace{0.375em}
\begin{isabellebody}
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \isacommand{inductive} foo\ {\isacharcolon}{\isacharcolon}\ {\isachardoublequoteopen}nat\ list\ {\isasymRightarrow}\ bool{\isachardoublequoteclose}\ \isakeyword{where}\isanewline
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ {\isachardoublequoteopen}foo\ {\isacharbrackleft}{\isacharbrackright}{\isachardoublequoteclose}\ {\isacharbar}\isanewline
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ {\isachardoublequoteopen}{\isasymlbrakk}\ foo\ xs\ {\isasymrbrakk}\ {\isasymLongrightarrow}\ foo {\isacharparenleft}5\#xs{\isacharparenright}{\isachardoublequoteclose}
\end{isabellebody}
\vspace{0.375em}
\noindent
introduces a new constant $\isa{foo}$ of type $\isa{nat list} \Rightarrow \isa{bool}$.
The two clauses in the body of the definition enumerate the conditions under which $\isa{foo}\ \isa{xs}$ is true, for arbitrary $\isa{xs}$.
The definition above states that $\isa{foo}$ is true at the empty list, or given a proof that $\isa{foo}\ \isa{xs}$ is true for some $\isa{xs}$, then $\isa{foo}\ (5\#\isa{xs})$ is true, also.
Further, $\isa{foo}\ \isa{xs}$ is true in no other circumstances---$\isa{foo}$ is the \emph{smallest} relation closed under the rules defining it.
In short, the clauses defining $\isa{foo}$ above state that $\isa{foo}\ \isa{xs}$ holds exactly in the case where $\isa{xs}$ is a (potentially empty) list containing only repeated copies of the natural number $5$.

Lemmas, theorems, and corollaries can be asserted using the $\isacommand{lemma}$, $\isacommand{theorem}$, and $\isacommand{corollary}$ keywords, respectively.
There is no semantic difference between these keywords in Isabelle.
A theorem statement of the form
\vspace{0.375em}
\begin{isabellebody}
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \isacommand{theorem} goo{\isacharcolon}\isanewline
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \isakeyword{assumes}\ foo\ xs \isakeyword{and}\ foo\ ys \isanewline
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \isakeyword{shows}\ foo (xs \isacharat ys)
\end{isabellebody}
\vspace{0.375em}
\noindent
produces a proof obligation, wherein the user is tasked with proving $\isa{foo} (xs \isacharat ys)$ under the two assumptions $\isa{foo}\ xs$ and $\isa{foo}\ ys$, where $xs \isacharat ys$ is list append.
An optional name, here $\isa{goo}$, is assigned to the theorem, so that it may be referenced in later proofs.

Lastly, we use \emph{locales}---or local theory environments~\cite{DBLP:conf/tphol/KammullerWP99,DBLP:conf/types/HaftmannW08}---extensively throughout our development to structure the proof.
A declaration of the form
\vspace{0.375em}
\begin{isabellebody}
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \isacommand{locale} hoo = \isanewline
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \isakeyword{fixes}\ f\ {\isacharcolon}{\isacharcolon}\ {\isachardoublequoteopen}{\isacharprime}a\ {\isasymRightarrow}\ {\isacharprime}a{\isachardoublequoteclose}\isanewline
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \isakeyword{assumes} {\isachardoublequoteopen}f\ x = x{\isachardoublequoteclose}
\end{isabellebody}
\vspace{0.375em}
\noindent
introduces a local theory, with a fixed, typed constant $\isa{f}$, and an associated law that states that $\isa{f}$ is the identity function.
Functions and constants may now be defined, and theorems conjectured and proved, within the context of the $\isa{hoo}$ theory.
This is indicated syntactically by writing $(\isacommand{in}\ hoo)$ before the name of the constant being defined, or the theorem being conjectured, at the point of definition or conjecture.
Any function, constant, or theorem, marked in this way may make reference to $\isa{f}$, or the fact that $\isa{f}\ \isa{x} = \isa{x}$ for all $\isa{x}$.
\emph{Interpreting} a local theory---such as $\isa{hoo}$ above---involves providing a concrete implementation of $\isa{f}$ coupled with a proof that the concrete implementation satisfies the associated law.
Once interpreted, all functions, definitions, and theorems made within the $\isa{hoo}$ local theory become available to use for that concrete implementation.
